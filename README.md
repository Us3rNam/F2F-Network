F2F-Network
===========

Friend-2-Friend Network

==================================================================================================

Network is completly decentralized.
It has no encryption at the moment, but will be implemented soon.
You can only communicate with 1 friend at a time per window
  (1 friend must be a server and listens, and the other connects to the server).
You can only talk with people that you "know"
  (Knowing somebody means connecting to them once)
  (On first connection with somebody your information is stored in a DB on their computer
    to communicate with you again on a later time)
Every individual has a unique 32 character ID (No nicknames)

===================================================================================================

Version 0.0.1:
  Run "Start.py"
  Database will be created for you on first run

====================================================================================================

To Come:
  AES or RSA Encryption
  OTR Implementation
  File Transfer
  GUI (undecided on its creation still)
  HashCash Implementation
